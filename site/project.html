        	In this era of Big Data, the analysis and use of data with appropriate tools have become as significant as natural resources. The Internet has created massive capacities of data in diverse fields in different type of dataset. As such, the importance of data visualization is increasingly growing in computer science, digital media art, and social science fields.

		Cloud Bridge explores how data can be visualized and sonified to facilitate findings, understand and analyze information by using multi-dimensional representation in an innovative way. It unfolds the history of item check-out records from the Seattle Public Library. Although surrounded by technologies, the artists are driven by the idea of combining traditional art representations with new interactive media projects.

        Your Vital Virtual is a dynamic work, which generates virtual surfaces from the changing mental state of the user. A brainBrane of sorts, unveiling a translated perspective of the visceral nature of the user’s mental actions through modulating virtual form and sound. A elastic surface dances, being pushed and pulled, modulated by the users engagement, as a field of the current action potential is scanned and presented as a changing state space. The colors act as indicators of attention and meditation, while an accompanying soundScape is generated and spatialized within the environment, offsetting the visual proportions into temporal and harmonic cues. At any point the user can freeze the process and select a moment of his/her particular interest. This frozen moment can be saved and using 3d printing, create a physical model of that particular moment. Drawings within the architectural realm are also produced as another expressive modality with the focus on the moment in action and modulation.

Alternity is an evolving trans-disciplinary installation and research project. The work in its various forms and artifacts seeks to address and experiment with the intimate connection between architecture and the body. Real-time sampling of the users biometrics (EEG data) and spatial tracking is translated through feedback and processed for harmonic and coherent characteristics. The changing state is rendered into an immersive environment composed of projections and sounds to be experienced and interpreted by the user. The creative interest of developing works that provide an experience that allows the world to connect to the reflective and reflexive processes that may provide new realms of dialogue in the architectural discourse. What if we can connect to the geometry around us, objects that cast shadows and embody our internal physical and mental states? Connecting the user to space through interaction, pushing up the line and redivided by composition and interpretation. Making space resonate with the body and placing the human as a focus of our constructed environments.

      <p><img src="img/bell.jpg" alt="" class="pull-right">Barot has just finished his final year at The Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, where he excelled in glass etching paintings and portraiture. Hailed as one of the most diverse artists of his generation, Barot is equally as skilled with watercolors as he is with oils, and is just as well-balanced in different subject areas. Barot’s collection entitled "The Un-Collection" will adorn the walls of Gilbert Hall, depicting his range of skills and sensibilities - all of them, uniquely Barot, yet undeniably different.</p>
